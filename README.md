# Scenario

When cloning this repository, make sure that you create a directory (and subdirectory) called Code/qt in your home directory, then cd into that directory and clone it with 

git clone https://github.com/tonningp/scenario.git

The projects are found in lessons.  To view the Rabbit Trap game go to lessons/game01 and open the game01.pro file using Qt Creator.  Configure it then run it in the Qt Creator program.  Please note, this program will not work if you did create the directory and sub directory Code/qt in your home directory.  You have been warned ;-)
